# 🚀 Getting Started - Choose Your Path

## 🕒 5-Minute Overview
1. **Run the simulation** - `python test_simulation/pure_python_sim.py`
2. **Read the manifesto** - `manifesto.md`
3. **See the legal framework** - `knowledge_base/Legal Frameworks/`
4. **Pick your role below**

## 👤 For Non-Technical
**Goal:** Spread the word, form legal entity, manage distribution

1. **Form an Ohio UNPA** (2+ people, zero filing)
   - Read: `knowledge_base/Legal Frameworks/ohio_unpa_framework.md`
   - Sign the template with 1+ person
   - You're now a legal entity

2. **Find a technical friend** to run the bot
3. **Document everything** publicly
4. **Help others start**

## 💻 For Technical
**Goal:** Deploy and run the system

1. **Test everything locally:**
   ```bash
   python test_simulation/pure_python_sim.py
   python decentralized_arbitrage/decentralized_arbitrage_bot.py
Get testnet crypto:

Polygon Amoy: https://faucet.polygon.technology

Use GitHub verification

Deploy contracts:

bash
python deployment_scripts/deploy_all.py
Run main bot:

bash
python arbitrage_bot/main.py
