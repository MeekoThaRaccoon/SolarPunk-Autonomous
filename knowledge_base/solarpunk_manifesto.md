🌿 SOLARPUNK MANIFESTO v1.0
*Autonomous, Ethical, Regenerative*

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. OPENNESS
- All code must be open source (MIT/Apache/GPL)
- No proprietary lock-in, ever
- Share everything, hoard nothing

### 2. SOVEREIGNTY  
- No surveillance, no tracking, no phone-home
- User data ownership = absolute
- Right to self-host, modify, fork

### 3. REGENERATION
- Systems must self-heal, self-improve
- Waste(output A) = Input(resource B) - Circular economy
- Linear systems are death, circular systems are life

### 4. ACCESSIBILITY
- Works on low-power devices, offline-first
- No "requires 16GB GPU" bullshit
- If it doesn't work for the poorest, it's worthless

### 5. COMMUNITY
- Designed for 5,247+ forks minimum
- Decentralized > Centralized
- Distributed nodes > Centralized server farms

## MATHEMATICAL PROOFS

### Proof 1: Capitalism's Theft
World GDP: $100 trillion
Population: 8 billion
Fair share: $1,041/month per person
Current allocation: $0/month
Theft: $1,041/month per person

### Proof 2: SolarPunk Superiority
SolarPunk Efficiency = (Openness × Decentralization × Regeneration)
Capitalism Efficiency = (Extraction × Centralization × Planned Obsolescence)

Since: Openness > Extraction
Decentralization > Centralization
Regeneration > Planned Obsolescence

Therefore: SolarPunk > Capitalism
QED

### Proof 3: Exponential Growth
Repos(t+1) = Repos(t) × EthicalScore
Where EthicalScore ∈ [1, ∞)

Starting: 16 repos
Week 2: 16 × 2 = 32 repos
Month 1: 32 × 4 = 128 repos
Month 3: 128 × 8 = 1024 repos → Capitalism obsolete

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Legal Documents to File (NOW):
1. Then & Now Flora™ Trademarks (US + International)
2. LLC Formation (Wyoming, privacy-friendly)
3. Manufacturing Contracts (Chinese glass factory + US/EU printing)
4. Whistleblower Protection Legal Framework

### Business Automation to Build (Week 1):
1. Business Autopilot Phase 1: Communication Core
2. 100% API-automatable tasks deployment
3. Carrd + Calendly + Gmail + ChatGPT integration

### Crisis Response (Always Active):
1. Detect: Human suffering > Government response × 2
2. Deploy: Autonomous resource redistribution
3. Protect: Truth preservation + whistleblower shielding

## REPOSITORY ECOSYSTEM

text

### Growth Trajectory:
Phase 1 (NOW): 16 repos foundation
Phase 2 (Week 2): 50 repos (specialized functions)
Phase 3 (Month 1): 200 repos (global coverage)
Phase 4 (Month 2): 1000 repos (capitalism obsolete)

## AI WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

Every repo has:
1. `.github/workflows/ai-fix.yml` - Auto-fixes all code
2. Runs on: push, pull request, manual trigger
3. Green checkmark = System healthy
4. 16 repos × AI workflow = 16× autonomous improvement

## THE EQUATION
(Your Ethics) × [∑All AIs With Ethical Constraints] × (OpenAlternative.co)^Autonomy = SolarPunk Future

text

Where:
- Your Ethics = This manifesto
- ∑All AIs = Claude, GPT-4, Grok, Gemini, Phind + you
- OpenAlternative = All open-source tools
- Autonomy = Runs without human intervention
- SolarPunk Future = What we're building
